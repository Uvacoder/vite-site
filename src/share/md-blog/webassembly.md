# what is webassembly

WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

## WASM == 汇编级性能？

不对！！！
WASM 里的 Assembly 并不意味着真正的汇编码，而只是种新约定的字节码，也是需要解释器运行的。
